## TO DO
todo: implement more filetpyes
todo: analyze performance
todo: handle synonymous filetypes
  # ex: disco is same as xml.  need to think about how to implement this
  # I could look at list https://www.file-extensions.org/extensions/common-file-extension-list
  # maybe openFile[filetype]().  openFile = {disco: open_xml, xml: open_xml


##  NOTES
modulename in sys.modules to check if module has been imported

filetype mapping to opener func:
* have dictionary of types to functions? <- this is want i want to map multiple filetypes to one function
* what if func arguments vary by function?  ex: one function accepts size param, other does not
*   sol: have all functions implement *args param
*   what about char detecting?
